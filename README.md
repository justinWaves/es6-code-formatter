# Hello, thank you for reviewing! 🌊🌊

### 🎉`The Second Solution`🎉

After the first code review, I ended up finding a much more secure solution that does not rely on dangerouslySetInnerHTML, and covers edge cases I missed.
I will spare you the details in this markdown file and instead I left comments in the main branch explaining the logic block by block.

### 🎁 `Bonus Feature`🎁

My bonus feature is a Dialog component, that allows you to change the inputted code!! This will take
a string from the textarea and convert it to an array of strings like the initial example. I also added
some light styling, and responsiveness for my own brains sake.

Thank you again, and I look forward to your feedback! 🌊
